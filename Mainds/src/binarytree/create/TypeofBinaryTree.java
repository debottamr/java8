 Perfect Binary Tree A Binary tree is Perfect Binary Tree in which all internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.

	 * Balanced Binary Tree A binary tree is balanced if the height of the tree is O(Log n) where n is the number of nodes. For Example, AVL tree maintains O(Log n) height by
	 * making sure that the difference between heights of left and right subtrees is 1. Red-Black trees maintain O(Log n) height by making sure that the number of Black nodes on
	 * every root to leaf paths are same and there are no adjacent red nodes. Balanced Binary Search trees are performance wise good as they provide O(log n) time for search,
	 * insert and delete.
